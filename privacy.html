    Balint Fodor built the Location Connection app as a free app. This service is provided by Balint Fodor at no cost and is intended for use as is.<br /><br />

    This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information if anyone decided to use my service.<br /><br />

    If you choose to use my service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The personal information that I collect is used for providing the service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.<br /><br />
    
    <b>Information collection and use</b><br /><br />    
    
    For both registered and non-registered users, the app will ask your consent to use location if you wish to take advantage of this feature.<br />   
    Non-registered users will send the last acquired position to my server when requesting a list of registered users. This will be used for calculating distance between you and them, so it can be displayed on their profile page, or used for distance filtering.<br />It is only stored on my server in the HTTP logs which are periodically deleted. Location is only acquired while you are using the app. <br />
    You have the option to set an address if you do not wish to use your own location.<br /><br />

    When registering a new account, the app sends the given data to my server, including the pictures you upload, and they will be stored, so other users can find you.<br />
    At any time you have the option to turn the location on or off, and set sharing levels such as:<br />
    - sharing location with everyone<br />
    - sharing location with users you liked<br />
    - sharing location with users you matched with<br />
    - sharing location with users you added as friend<br />
    - not sharing it with anyone<br />
    The same applies to distance.<br /><br />
    Location is acquired by default both while you are using the app and in the background. Background access can be turned off in the app's Settings.<br /><br />

    A list of locations acquired in the last 24 hours is stored on your device, and displays as a timeline in the app's Location History page.<br />
    The server however only keeps the last location data of registered users. Turning off location in your account deletes these data from the server too.<br /><br />

    Your matches and conversation history is stored on the server indefinitely, and if you unmatch from someone, the match will disappear from your account. It is deleted from the server when both parties choose to do so.<br />
    When deleting your account, all records of it are removed from the server, except the conversation history of your matches if the other person has not unmatched yet.<br /><br />

    <b>Service Providers</b><br /><br />

    The app uses <a target="_blank" href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging">Firebase Cloud Messaging</a> to transmit messages and notifications. It works by accessing your device identifier, which is then sent to my server for use when sending data to your device.<br />
    They are obligated to perform the tasks assigned to them, and not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.<br /><br />

    <b>Security</b><br /><br />
    
    I value your trust in providing us your personal information, this I am striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it.<br />
    But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.<br /><br />

    <b>Childrenâ€™s Privacy</b><br /><br />

    The app does not inherently feature adult content, and it does not require birth date either for use. It is not however censored, therefore its content is entirely dependent on how the registered users represent themselves.<br />
    To comply with the current regulations, I do not address anyone under the age of 13, and I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. In the case I discover that a child under 13 has provided me with personal information, I immediately delete this from my server. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided me with personal information, please contact me so that I will be able to do necessary actions.<br /><br />
