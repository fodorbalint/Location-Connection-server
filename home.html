<div class="contentMain">

</div> 
<div class="contentMain">
    With relations kept secret, your chances to match would be like hitting a target with an arrow blindfolded.<br />
    Here you can find the list of people you liked or hid, or the other way. And you can change your mind too.<br />

</div> 
<div class="contentMain">
    You can set a location and distance to find people around you, or in your chosen area.<br />
    Users can opt in to have their location registered on their profiles, and also decide whether they want to display it as a point on the map or just show distance.<br />
    Furthermore, location and distance sharing is customizable: you can show it to everyone, to your likes, your matches, or only those you added as friend.

    You can also search for a range of numbers to find for example those who specified their age.<br />

<div class="feature">
    Be in control of your visibility
</div> 
<div class="contentMain">
    Instead of some hidden algorithm, your last active date, response rate and register date will determine if you appear on the top of the search lists.<br />
    Keeping the statistics in good standing shows your authenticity, but do not worry, people can find you in the opposite case too: the sort order can be reversed.

<div class="feature">
    Chat with certainty
</div> 
<div class="contentMain">
    You can see if your messages were read and when.<br />

</div> 
<div class="contentMain">
    As a convenience feature, if you match with someone, you can send them your location at regular intervals, and if they are looking at your profile, they will see your position change on the map.<br />
    This can come in handy when you arrange a date with someone.

        I am Balint Fodor, the developer of Location Connection.<br />
        <br />
        From early childhood I have been interested in making contact with the opposite sex, and with the advent of dating sites, I continued my quest of finding a girlfriend using the Internet.<br />
        I went on two dates in the beginning - none of which resulted in a relationship; years later however I met a girl on the street whom I was together with for one and half years.<br />
        Smartphones and apps were invented meanwhile, promising new ways to socialize, but even after an extensive usage of dating systems, one date is all I got, which, by the way, went like in my early days.<br />
        I would move on and get to know more people to find someone who is compatible with me - the thing is just, I did not get another chance. You would have to wait months to match with someone (if at all) - and then you are still not guaranteed to get a conversation going.<br />
        Whether you have 0 or 100 matches, finding someone where the attraction is mutual can be a challenge.<br /><br />
        Using profit-oriented apps that hide information from you means, you are not just restricted in your possibilities but are likely to come across people who themselves have a tendency to keep secrets.<br />
        But this is the norm in the dating world in 2020.<br />
        I wonder why no one has created a non-profit community yet or implemented a business strategy where normal users are given full access, and those who use the apps excessively bear the costs. You may be able to find a free app - where you are distracted by ads, and from what I have seen, the concept and implementation could be improved.<br />
        <br />
        I started working on Location Connection on 28 September 2019.<br />It was open for registration already a month later, though it took me 3 months to publish the app on Google Play, and the same amount of time was needed for the iOS version too. After 8 months in total, the platform became error-free in my tests and ready to be advertised.<br /><br />
        You may now look through the registered profiles to see if there is anyone who interests you. Or create a profile, so others can find you later.<br />
        Whatever your use case is, do not hesitate to <a onclick="showContactForm()" href="#amessageform">contact me</a> if you run into any issues, have a question or suggestion.
