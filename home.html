        I am Balint Fodor, the developer of Location Connection.<br />
        <br />
        From early childhood I have been interested in making contact with the opposite sex, and with the advent of dating sites, I continued my quest of finding a girlfriend using the Internet.<br />
        I went on two dates in the beginning - none of which resulted in a relationship; years later however I met a girl on the street whom I was together with for one and half years.<br />
        Smartphones and apps were invented meanwhile, promising new ways to socialize, but even after an extensive usage of dating systems, one date is all I got, which, by the way, went like in my early days.<br />
        I would move on and get to know more people to find someone who is compatible with me - the thing is just, I did not get another chance. You would have to wait months to match with someone (if at all) - and then you are still not guaranteed to get a conversation going.<br />
        Whether you have 0 or 100 matches, finding someone where the attraction is mutual can be a challenge.<br /><br />
        Using profit-oriented apps that hide information from you means, you are not just restricted in your possibilities but are likely to come across people who themselves have a tendency to keep secrets.<br />
        But this is the norm in the dating world in 2020.<br />
        I wonder why no one has created a non-profit community yet or implemented a business strategy where normal users are given full access, and those who use the apps excessively bear the costs. You may be able to find a free app - where you are distracted by ads, and from what I have seen, the concept and implementation could be improved.<br />
        <br />
        I started working on Location Connection on 28 September 2019.<br />It was open for registration already a month later, though it took me 3 months to publish the app on Google Play, and the same amount of time was needed for the iOS version too. After 8 months in total, the platform became error-free in my tests and ready to be advertised.<br /><br />
        You may now look through the registered profiles to see if there is anyone who interests you. Or create a profile, so others can find you later.<br />
        Whatever your use case is, do not hesitate to <a onclick="showContactForm()" href="#amessageform">contact me</a> if you run into any issues, have a question or suggestion.
